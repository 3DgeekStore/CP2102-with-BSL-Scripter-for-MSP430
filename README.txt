
Using a CP2102 with BSL-Scripter for MSP430
-------------------------------------------

This is about using a CP2102 or similar USB-to-Uart adapter as the hardware
interface when flashing MSP430 parts with TI's BSL-Scripter software.

Included is Windows software to generate the BSL invoke pattern on /Reset
and Test, as well as simple hardware that disconnects DTR from /Reset when
Scripter runs, which allows flashing to proceed.

Everything is explained in the PDF file.
